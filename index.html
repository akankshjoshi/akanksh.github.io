        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I am a proactive and enthusiastic individual with a Bachelor's in Computer Applications and currently pursuing a Post Graduate Program in Digital Product and Design Management from IIIT Bangalore. I am seeking an internship opportunity in Product Management or Product Analytics to apply my technical foundation and passion for building user-centric, data-driven digital solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I possess strong analytical and problem-solving skills, along with excellent attention to detail.
        <p>
         I am a quick learner with a strong ability to collaborate in team environments. Through my current coursework in Digital Product and Design Management at IIIT Bangalore, I have developed a solid foundation in product strategy, user experience design, and data-driven decision-making. My technical background in BCA has equipped me with programming skills in Java, C++, and Python, and I am also familiar with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript‚Äîenabling me to effectively bridge the gap between technical teams and business goals.
